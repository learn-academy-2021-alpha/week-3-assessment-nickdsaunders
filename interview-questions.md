# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

4. What is the difference between a HTML div and a span?

  Your answer:

  I know a HTML div is used to wrap an element and create a container for it. This container can then be given a class name and referenced in the CSS page to style the div. I am not really sure what a span is.

  Researched answer:

  A div (division) is a block-level element and should be used to wrap larger sections of a document. A span is an inline element used to wrap small portions of text, images, etc.



5. What is a React Fragment (or <>) and why would you want to use it?

  Your answer: 

  React Fragments are used in the render section of a class and allow you to call a child componenet within the parent class.

  Researched answer:

  React Fragments are a simple way to group a list of children components without adding extra nodes to the DOM. This can be very useful in passing around groups of React elements. They can be written as <React.Fragment></React.Fragment> or simply <></>.



6. What does it mean to create a responsive UI? What are three options for creating responsive design?

  Researched answer: A JavaScript keyword that refers to the object it belongs to.



9. STRETCH: What is a ternary operator in JavaScript?

  Your answer: 
  
  Not exatly sure but I think it's a short hand way of writing an if statement where you would write a condition and then a "?" (think this is what would be referred to as the "ternanry") and then write the value you would want it to test.

  Researched answer: 
  
  The ternary operator, often used as a shortcut for the "if" statemetn, is a conditional operator that takes three operands. The first being a condition followed by a question mark "?", second an expression to execute if the condition is truthy followed by a colon ":", and the third part is the expression to execute if the condition is falsey.



10. STRETCH: What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer:



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week
- Ruby - an interpreted scripting programming language built for front and back end development.

- Object oriented programming - Basic idea is that you use objects to model real world things we want to represent inside our programs, and or to provide a simple way to access functionality that would otherwise be hard to make sense of.

- RSpec - a testing tool for ruby.

- Instance variable - An objectâ€™s scope is populated with instance variables, in the moment we assign something to them. And they are visible everywhere in the object, that is, in every method that the object has.

- Ruby blocks - are anonymous functions that can be passed into methods.

- Ruby hashes a collection of key-value pairs.
